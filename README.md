## About

Rick And Morty: Jerry's Game is the balloon-popping game that Jerry gets addicted to during one of the episodes of the hilarious animated series Rick and Morty. The game is just as you see it in the episode: a crude simulator where you pop the balloons that appear on the screen.

Gameplay in Rick And Morty: Jerry's Game is so repetitive to the point of absurdity. This game is simply a parody of the genre, so its gameplay is identical to the games it's making fun of.

Rick And Morty: Jerry's Game is a strange game, because although it's not fun in and of itself, it should be a lot of fun for any fan of Rick and Morty, especially whenever the pair shows up to congratulate you.


## Description

When you start playing Rick And Morty: Jerry's Game, you have absolutely nothing: no music, no variety of balloons, no changes in scenery, no way to leave the game halfway, nothing.
